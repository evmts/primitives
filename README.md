**The ultrafast EVM for every language and platform**

---

## 🚧 Development Status (Early Alpha)

**Current Status**: DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

Guillotine is not suitable for production use at this time. Any use of Guillotine should be considered purely experimental. There are known bugs and TODOs. Follow the [issue tracker](https://github.com/evmts/Guillotine/issues) for features planned for Beta.

**Network Support**: Currently only **Ethereum Mainnet** is supported. Planned for Beta:

- **OP Stack** support (Optimism, Base, etc.)
- **Arbitrum Nitro** support

## 📊 Benchmarks & Bundle Size 🚧

Guillotine is fast.

Benchmarks so far look very promising.

- Guillotine shows measurable performance gains over [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) and performance on par with [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone).
- More major optimizations planned for Beta release

### Overall Performance Summary (Per Run)

These benchmarks were taken using the [evm-bench](https://github.com/ziyadedher/evm-bench) test cases with `hyperfine`.

- Benchmarking infra can be seen in previous commits but is currently being moved to its [own dedicated repo](https://github.com/evmts/evm-benchmarks).
- Looking for contributors to help set up easily reproducible benchmarks

| Test Case               | Guillotine | REVM     | Geth     | evmone   |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| erc20-approval-transfer | 1.59 ms    | 1.67 ms  | 3.65 ms  | 1.56 ms  |
| erc20-mint              | 4.28 ms    | 5.76 ms  | 12.84 ms | 4.26 ms  |
| erc20-transfer          | 6.65 ms    | 8.30 ms  | 17.50 ms | 6.01 ms  |
| ten-thousand-hashes     | 2.46 ms    | 3.31 ms  | 9.36 ms  | 2.90 ms  |
| snailtracer             | 26.41 ms   | 39.01 ms | 86.02 ms | 27.15 ms |

### Bundle size 🚧

In past commits we reduced the EVM to ~110 KB, with further improvements expected.

- We’re currently focused on `ReleaseFast`; `ReleaseSmall` support returns soon

---

### How is Guillotine so fast?

Guillotine was built using [data-oriented design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc) with an emphasis on [minimizing branch-prediction misses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nczJ58WvtYo) in the CPU. We studied every EVM implementation as well as [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), and [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter implementations for the state of the art. Optimizations include, from most impactful to least impactful:

- An extremely optimized StackFrame and opcode dispatch data structure
- [Indirect threading via tailcall recursion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43317592) (for excellent CPU branch prediction)
- Highly microoptimized opcode instruction handlers
- Highly microoptimized EVM stack implementation
- Opcode fusions turning common opcode patterns into a single dispatch
- **Assembly-optimized Keccak** via [keccak-asm](https://crates.io/crates/keccak-asm)
- Batching calculation of static gas costs and stack analysis
- Simple code that minimizes unnecessary abstractions, inline directives, and interfaces allowing the Zig compiler maximum freedom to optimize for performance or size
- Additional micro-optimizations not listed

**Balanced tradeoffs**

We focus on maintainable code and targeted optimizations where they matter. We do our best to write simple code the Zig compiler can optimize.

There are many more optimizations that have not been implemented yet. The biggest of which will be translating our stack-based EVM into a register-based EVM—a common technique used by interpreters like Lua and PyPy, and Cranelift-style designs—to achieve up to ~30% performance increases.

---

### How is Guillotine so small?

- Zig avoids hidden control flow.
- This makes it really easy to write the most minimal simple code needed to get the job done.
- By minimizing unnecessary abstractions the compiler is able to do a great job optimizing for size.
- Zig `comptime` allows us to easily and surgically only include the minimum necessary code given the specific EVM and hard fork configuration. Code you don't use isn't included.

### How is Guillotine so safe?

Guillotine is not yet “safe”; it’s in early alpha. But we do have features that help improve safety:

- Guillotine can be built in `Debug`, `ReleaseFast`, `ReleaseSmall`, and `ReleaseSafe`.
- We recommend `ReleaseSafe` while in alpha.
- `ReleaseSafe` preserves debug‑mode‑only defensive checks, memory safety features, and other safeguards in the final binary.
- Guillotine also features extensive unit, E2E, fuzz, benchmark, and differential test suites.

---

## 🚧 Full Client

Guillotine is a VM implementation (like [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm)) not a full node (like [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth)).
However, [Tevm](https://github.com/evmts/tevm-monorepo) (the team behind Guillotine) plans to begin work on a highly performant Zig-based full client soon. This client will leverage parts of Guillotine's architecture to execute transactions in parallel and architect around I/O bottlenecks.

---

## Additional features

### Zero Config

Guillotine ships with opinionated defaults and is mainnet‑ready with zero configuration.

---

### Customizability

Guillotine is built from the ground up to be a highly customizable EVM SDK.

**With Guillotine you can easily create your own EVM!**

Using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) `comptime`, you configure features with regular Zig code, and the compiler includes only what you use. [REVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) offers similar customizability but requires more onboarding into complex generics and feature flags compared to Zig `comptime`.

Customizability features include

- Configure any hard fork or EIP
- Add or override opcodes and precompiles in the EVM
- Simple, powerful tracer interface for introspection
- Comprehensive options to configure the EVM (including niche settings like changing the word size from `u256`)
- `comptime` validation to ensure configurations are sound

All customizations are zero‑cost, compile‑time abstractions using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) `comptime`, so customizations never sacrifice runtime performance and your bundle includes only the features you choose to use.

For most users who don't need customizations, we offer default options for all major hard forks.

🚧 This feature is considered experimental and the API could change.

---

## 🔁 Relationship to Tevm

Once stable, **Guillotine’s Wasm build** will replace the current JavaScript EVM in [Tevm](https://node.tevm.sh).
Upgrades include:

- 🚀 **Up to 1000x performance boost**
- 📉 **300 KB (75%) bundle size reduction**
- 🧱 **Fast Ethereum library** An ultrafast utility and client library wrapping the Guillotine primitives package
