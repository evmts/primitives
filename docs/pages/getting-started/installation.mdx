Guillotine is in early alpha and is **NOT suitable for production use**. 
Currently, only building from source is supported.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before installing Guillotine, ensure you have the following:

::::steps
### Install Zig

Guillotine requires Zig 0.14.1 or later.

:::code-group

```bash [macOS]
brew install zig
```

```bash [Linux]
# Download from https://ziglang.org/download/
wget https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.1/zig-linux-x86_64-0.14.1.tar.xz
tar -xf zig-linux-x86_64-0.14.1.tar.xz
sudo mv zig-linux-x86_64-0.14.1 /usr/local/zig
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/zig
```

```bash [Windows]
# Download installer from https://ziglang.org/download/
# Or use scoop:
scoop install zig
```

:::

### Install Git

```bash
# Verify git is installed
git --version
```

### Install Build Tools (Optional)

For running benchmarks and tests:

```bash
# Install Bun (optional, for benchmarks)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
::::

## Building from Source

::::steps
### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evmts/Guillotine.git
cd Guillotine
```

### Build Guillotine

Build with default settings (recommended):

```bash
zig build
```

Build modes available:

:::code-group

```bash [Debug]
# Full debug symbols and safety checks
zig build -Doptimize=Debug
```

```bash [ReleaseSafe (Recommended)]
# Production-ready with safety checks
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

```bash [ReleaseFast]
# Maximum performance, minimal checks
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

```bash [ReleaseSmall]
# Optimized for binary size
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
```

:::

### Verify Installation

Run the test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
zig build test
```

Expected output:
```
All tests passed.
```

## Using Guillotine

### As a Zig Library

Add Guillotine to your `build.zig`:

```zig
const guillotine = b.dependency("guillotine", .{
    .target = target,
    .optimize = optimize,
});

exe.root_module.addImport("guillotine", guillotine.module("guillotine"));
```

### As a C Library

Build the C headers:

```bash
zig build c-api
```

This generates:
- `zig-out/include/guillotine.h` - C header file
- `zig-out/lib/libguillotine.a` - Static library

Include in your C project:

```c
#include "guillotine.h"

int main() {
    guillotine_evm_t* evm = guillotine_evm_create();
    // Use the EVM...
    guillotine_evm_destroy(evm);
    return 0;
}
```

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Linux x86_64 | ‚úÖ Supported | Primary development platform |
| macOS (Intel) | ‚úÖ Supported | Fully tested |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | ‚úÖ Supported | Fully tested |
| Windows | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental | Basic support |
| WASM | üöß Coming Soon | Planned for beta |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

:::details[Zig version mismatch]
**Error**: `error: incompatible Zig version`

**Solution**: Ensure you have Zig 0.14.1 or later:
```bash
zig version
```
:::

:::details[Build fails with allocation error]
**Error**: `error: OutOfMemory`

**Solution**: Increase available memory or use ReleaseSmall mode:
```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
```
:::

:::details[Tests fail on first run]
**Error**: `error: FileNotFound`

**Solution**: Ensure you're in the project root directory:
```bash
pwd # Should show /path/to/Guillotine
zig build test
```
