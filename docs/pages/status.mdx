# Project Status

- Alpha; not production-ready
- Interfaces may change
- Correctness over performance

## Build Modes

- **Debug**: Full debugging symbols and runtime checks
- **ReleaseFast**: Optimized for maximum performance
- **ReleaseSmall**: Optimized for minimal bundle size
- **ReleaseSafe** (‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED FOR ALPHA**): Includes parallel validation EVM, safety checks, and comprehensive logging

## What to expect:
- Passing tests are silent by design
- Run `zig build && zig build test-opcodes` before/after changes
- Report failures with exact command and code
- Use ReleaseSafe mode for development and testing

For milestones, see the Roadmap and GitHub.
