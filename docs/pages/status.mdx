# Project Status

- Alpha; not production-ready
- Interfaces may change
- Correctness over performance

What to expect:
- Passing tests are silent by design
- Run `zig build && zig build test-opcodes` before/after changes
- Report failures with exact command and code

For milestones, see the Roadmap and GitHub.
