# Project Status

Guillotine is currently in early alpha. It is not production ready and interfaces may change.

## What this means

- Public API is still evolving; expect breaking changes
- Performance is a priority but correctness comes first
- Documentation aims for accuracy; report gaps or errors

## Network Support

- **Currently supported**: Ethereum Mainnet only
- **Planned for Beta**:
  - OP Stack support (Optimism, Base, etc.)
  - Arbitrum Nitro support

## Near-term focus

- Tightening EVM core correctness across forks
- Differential tests and fuzzing improvements
- Stabilizing the `Evm.init`/`Evm.call` surface

## How to help

- Try the examples and report issues
- Contribute unit tests and spec references
- Propose ergonomics for common tasks (calldata building, result helpers)

See the [Roadmap](/roadmap) for more details.
