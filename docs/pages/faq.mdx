# FAQ

## Versions

- Zig: use 0.15.1+ (`zig version` to confirm)
- OS: Linux/macOS recommended; on Windows, use WSL

## Build and Test

- List steps: `zig build --list-steps`
- Build: `zig build`
- Opcode tests: `zig build test-opcodes`
- All tests: `zig build test`

## Troubleshooting

- Out of memory during build: try `--maxrss` or close other processes
- Ops tests hang: run a single step to isolate (e.g., `zig build test-opcodes-0x01`)
- Silent tests: passing tests print nothing (expected)

## Enable Debug Logs in Tests

```zig
test {
    std.testing.log_level = .debug;
}
```

## Reporting Issues

Open a GitHub issue with:
- Zig version and OS
- Minimal reproduction (code/command)
- Expected vs. actual behavior

That’s it—keep it factual and reproducible.
