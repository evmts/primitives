# Compatibility

Factual notes on what is and is not supported.

## Bytecode format

- EOF (EVM Object Format): not supported.
  - Code must be legacy bytecode.
  - Deploying EOF code will be executed as raw opcodes (non-compliant). Do not deploy EOF.

## Precompiles

- Precompiles are enabled by default; addresses 0x01–0x0A and selected others are implemented in `src/precompiles/`.
- Behavior and gas follow the spec; see source for the current set.
- Can be disabled via `-Dno_precompiles=true` (build option) if needed.

## Transient storage

- EIP‑1153 transient storage is implemented (`Database.get_transient_storage` / `set_transient_storage`).
- Transient state is per-transaction and cleared by design.

## Delegated code (EOA)

- EIP‑7702‑style delegation is supported in `Database.get_code_by_address`:
  - EOAs may delegate to another address’s code.
  - Use `set_delegation` / `clear_delegation` accordingly.

## Block-scope processing

- On `Evm.init`, block-scoped updates are invoked when applicable:
  - Beacon root (EIP‑4788), historical block hashes (EIP‑2935), validator deposits (EIP‑6110), validator withdrawals (EIP‑7002).
- Errors are traced; see `src/evm.zig` init for details.

## Hardforks

- Default hardfork: Cancun. Override via `-Devm-hardfork=...` (see `zig build -h`).
- Limits (bytecode/initcode size, memory, depth) are enforced per `EvmConfig`.
