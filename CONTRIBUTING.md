```

If your contribution is large please open a discussion to chat about the change before doing the work.

## Critical Safety Requirements

**⚠️ WARNING: This is mission-critical financial infrastructure.** ANY bug can result in catastrophic loss of funds. Please follow these requirements:

### Zero Tolerance Policy
- ❌ **NO** broken builds or failing tests
- ❌ **NO** stub implementations (`error.NotImplemented`)
- ❌ **NO** commented-out code (use Git for history)
- ❌ **NO** `std.debug.print` in production code (use `log.zig`)
- ❌ **NO** skipping tests or disabling problematic code

### Memory Safety
- **Always** pair allocations with `defer` or `errdefer`
- **Always** validate memory bounds before access
- **Always** zero-initialize expanded memory regions
- **Never** leak memory - proper cleanup is mandatory

### Testing Requirements
- **Every** code change must pass `zig build test-opcodes`
- **Critical** changes require differential testing against revm
- **Gas costs** must match Yellow Paper specification exactly
- **Stack operations** must validate depth before execution

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. All contributors are expected to:

- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on constructive criticism and collaborative problem-solving
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences

- `src/instructions/*.zig` - Individual opcode handlers for the evm
- `src/tracer/tracer.zig` - Execution tracing and debugging infrastructure

- `src/root.zig` - Module root exports
- `build.zig` - Main build configuration

## Code Quality Standards

### Assertion and Error Handling
- Use `tracer.assert()` with descriptive messages for runtime validation
- Provide clear error messages that help debugging
- Handle all error cases explicitly - no silent failures
- Use `errdefer` for cleanup on error paths

### Documentation
- Each module should have a CLAUDE.md file documenting:
  - Mission-critical aspects
  - Implementation details
  - Safety requirements
  - Testing guidelines
- Keep documentation close to code for maintainability

### Performance Considerations
- Use `_unsafe` operations only after validation
- Implement tail call optimization for opcode dispatch
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Profile before optimizing

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Guillotine.git
   cd Guillotine
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/evmts/Guillotine.git
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Zig 0.15.1 or later
- Git
- Rust toolchain (required for ark and revm dependencies)
- Golang and node.js if working with the cli and native app

### Building the Project

#### First-time Setup (Fresh Machine)

When building on a fresh machine or after a fresh clone, you need to initialize submodules:

```bash
# Initialize and update git submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the project (Zig automatically runs cargo build for Rust dependencies)
zig build

# Run tests (use test-opcodes to avoid hanging issues)
zig build test-opcodes
```

**Note**: The Zig build system automatically runs `cargo build` as a dependency step when building Rust libraries. On the first build, this may take longer as Cargo downloads and compiles dependencies.

#### Regular Development

```bash
# Build the project
zig build

# Run tests
zig build test-opcodes
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Always verify builds**: After any code change, run:
   ```bash
   zig build && zig build test-opcodes
   ```
2. **Enable debug logging** in tests when needed:
   ```zig
   test {
       std.testing.log_level = .debug;
   }
   ```
3. **Use tracer assertions** for debugging instead of `std.debug.assert`:
   ```zig
   // Good - provides context on failure
   self.getTracer().assert(condition, "descriptive message");

   // Avoid - no context on failure
   std.debug.assert(condition);
   ```
4. **Test against MinimalEvm** for correctness verification:
   ```bash
   zig build test-snailtracer  # Differential testing
   ```
